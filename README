SYNOPSIS
      # in app.psgi

      builder {
          enable "JSConcat",
              files => [<static/js/*.js>],
              filter => '/usr/local/bin/jsmin';
          $app;
      };

      # use $env{'psgix.jsconcat.url'} to include javascript.

DESCRIPTION

    javascripts files into one. It provides a content-hashed key as the url
    for including all the javascript files you specified. You can also
    provide a filter program to minimize the concatenated file.
